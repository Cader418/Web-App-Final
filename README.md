# Web-App-Final
Final Project for Mobile/Web Applications

FOLDER ORGANIZATION:
  We kept our organization very simple. Within our main Project folder, we have all of the php files. This includes all of the front-end and back-end files. 
  The main Project folder also has 4 child folders:
    js: this folder contains some javascript files used in our modules.
    img: this folder contains the images that we needed for our front-end.
    css: this folder contains all of the css (except bootstrap) that was used to style the project.
    components: This folder was intended to contain the parts of the frond-end that are used in multiple pages. It only contains the header currently.
